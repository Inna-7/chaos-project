            üî• Are you ready for an unprecedented intergalactic adventure? Dive
            into the secrets and riches of the mining planet ChaosX-18! Here's
            how to get started:
          </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Account Access:</b> To embark on this thrilling journey, you'll
            need a WAX account. Access the game by "burning" your Teleport NFT
            directly from your preferred wallet (AtomicHub, NEFTY, HIVE, etc.).
            Click on the purchased Teleport NFT and burn it to secure access for
            one season. Then, head to the game's website and log in using your
            preferred service, Wax Cloud, or Anchor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>First Access:</b> As you step into the world of ChaosX-18, you'll
            be granted a fixed amount of 500 Aurum and 500 Celium as a welcome
            bonus. However, you won't have any mines or Slot Building NFTs yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Purchase Mine and Slot Building NFTs:</b> To kickstart your
            growth journey, you must acquire Mine and Slot Building NFTs. You
            can find these items in the official game drops or on secondary
            markets like neftyblocks.com and wax.atomichub.io. Once obtained,
            you'll be ready to use them in-game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>My Profile - The Heart of the Game:</b> Here's where your mining
            empire comes to life! The "My Profile" section is the command center
            for your activities. Observe your precious staked assets and enjoy
            the opportunity to collect the riches produced by your mines simply
            by clicking "Mine."
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Structure Details:</b> The key to your growth lies in optimizing
            your mines. Click on "Details" next to the building's picture to
            discover the specifics of each structure. In addition to the upgrade
            cost, you'll also see the future production you'll gain by
            upgrading. These tactical tips will help you make strategic
            decisions and maximize your profits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Upgrade the Structures:</b> Don't settle for less! Utilize the
            resources produced by your mines along with Upgrade Token NFTs to
            improve the level of your structures. Climb higher and higher on the
            leaderboard, edging closer to the top of the prize pool.
          </li>

            of chaos!
